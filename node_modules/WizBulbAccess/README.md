**setLightTemp(level)** (Parameter level = value in Kelin (K)). This call sets the color temperature of the bulb to the value in Kelvin. The library accepts 2200K to 6500K although not all bulbs from Wiz can support this.

**setColorRGB(red,green,blue)** (Parameters red, green and blue are *NUMBERS*). This call sets the color of the bulb to based on the RBG value.
